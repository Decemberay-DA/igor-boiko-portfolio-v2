## like plan or something

yo this is such a simple thing, why is it taking that long time to do?

---
- [ ] prototype stuff in pixso da
- [ ] html of base page without modals or other pages
- [ ] ESCEngine and stuff on 3d bg
---

## plan for later future

- [ ] try modal router thingy with modal project window / its own tab
- [ ] add animations with Framere Motion and css imaje parallax effect
- [ ] try making buttons as 3d objects

        <View >
            <Groupe / >
                <CursorLeaningBehaviour />
                <ClickResponceBehaviour />
                <ButtonThreeMesh icon="nuts" />
- [ ] add smooth scrolling to the pages (like stole it)
- [ ] Use https://uploadthing-1m3c.vercel.app/ to upload .glb scene to it and load them to this website
    - [ ] add gltf loading curtains
    - [ ] split bg loading to 2 parts 
        1) created from fiber objects and being generated offline 
        2) being my .glb that is downloading from web

#### modal thingy








#### install from three-fiber-starter: --done

Installed:
    three@0.160.1 - The main three.js library, a lightweight 3D library with a default WebGL renderer. Used for creating and displaying animated 3D computer graphics in web applications.
    @react-three/fiber@8.16.3 - A React renderer for three.js, used for building interactive 3D animations and visualizations in React applications.
    @react-three/drei@9.105.6 - A collection of reusable helpers, abstractions, and components to enhance the use of react-three/fiber, making it easier to build 3D scenes.
    three-stdlib@2.29.11 - A stable collection of general-purpose modules extracted from the three.js code examples, offering extended functionalities beyond the core library.
    tunnel-rat@0.1.2 - Used for network tunneling capabilities; it facilitates connections between separated networks which cannot directly connect to each other.

SusCzIAmStoopid:
    (what even is it?) => @ducanh2912/next-pwa@10.2.7 - Integrates Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality with Next.js, enabling offline capabilities and improved loading times.
    file-loader@6.2.0 - Webpack loader to manage importing/including files such as images and fonts into your projects, handling them as URL/file dependencies.
    glslify-loader@2.0.0 - A Webpack loader for glslify, which allows importing GLSL shader code into JavaScript files as modules.
    glslify@7.1.1 - A node.js-style module system for GLSL, allowing the composition of shaders from various sources, enhancing reusability and maintainability.
    url-loader@4.1.1 - A Webpack loader similar to file-loader, but can return a Data URL if the file is smaller than a byte limit, reducing the number of requests needed for small files.

Plan:
    - [x] display styff in usual fiber components
    - [x] test how routing will work in standard fiber components
    - [x] redisplay it using stolen code from three-fiber-starter
